# Ultimate Bias


Ultimate Bias is a card game I invented involving K-Pop idols. It's a point-earning card game with many influences, primarily from Gin, Rummy, and Magic: The Gathering. I will update more here as the project progresses!

## Current Next Steps of Implementation:
- Create an enum for Idols with name, nationality
- Change artist enums to use idol enum instead of strings
- Update PlayArea / PlaySet design & heirarchy
- Begin design for the game engine (high level turn handling)
