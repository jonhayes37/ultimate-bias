# Ultimate Bias


Ultimate Bias is a card game I invented involving K-Pop idols. It's a point-earning card game with many influences, primarily from Gin, Rummy, and Magic: The Gathering. I will update more here as the project progresses!

## Current Next Steps of Implementation:
- Add all artists to enum file
- Add all labels to enum file
- Program the initial player creation, card dealing before game start
